1.Qa Team(testing team)
    a.BRD (business requirement document)
    b.based on brd docuent qa and ui developers used to 
       design wirefraes.wirefraes is a pdf file
    c.used to done data modeling
        a.how any tables we need
        b.what are  the columns for each table
        d.what  are  the validations for each column
        c.design relationship  between table
 
2.developent team
    1.generate  migration for to create keywords,programming_urls tables
    2.create model called  keyword.rb,programming_url.rb in app/models/
    3.we need to write validations in model keyword.rb,programming_url.rb
    4.run rake db:create   if database does not exits,
         rake db:migrate   this coand will create tables  in the database
    5.we need to create keywords_controller.rb , 
           programming_urls_controller.rb,in app/controllers/
    6.we nedd to define appropriate actions in cotroller files
    7.we need to create one folder for each controller in app/views/ directory
         i.e.  keywords programing_urls
    8.based on the functionality we need to design views 
    9.need to give entry in routes.rb
        a. ex:  resources :keywords,:programming_urls
              resources will generates 7 crud actions index,show,new,create,update

           ex: resources :keywords,:programming_urls, only:[:index,:new,:destroy]
           ex:  resources :keywords,:programing_urls do 
                     resources :users
                end
       b.collection and member to add extra actions than crud actions
    10. we need to unit testing
    11.git add  .
    12.git commit -am "impleentation of keyword segent done"
    13.git push origin dbrearc_8
    14.rspec ---> this command used to run all the rspecs(model,controller,routing)
    15.create a file in  keyword_spec.rb in spec/models/ directory
        a.need to write spec validations
        b.need write spec for associations
        c.need write spec for table schema
        d.need write spec for methods defined in the model
    16 to test model spec 
          a. rspec spec/models/keyword_spec.rb 
          b.rspec spec/models   -->  this is used run specs of all models
   17. create a file in spec/controllers called keywords_controller_spec.rb
        a.write  spec for  all controller actions
        b.spec for all private methods
        c. to run rspec  spec/controlles/keywords_controllers_spec.rb
        d. rspec controllers/
   18.create file in spec/routing/kewords_routing_spec.rb
       a.write spec for routable routes
       b. write spec for non-routable routes
       c.write spec for collection and member actions
       d.rspec  spec/routing/keyword_routing_spec.rb
